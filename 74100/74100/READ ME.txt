Assumptions:

Config File:
Population_Type: fc														(pick just one: l (for lattice), xpto(there's only code for lattices, this field is used for data susbcribers))
Links_file_Path: Networks/fc_5.txt										(one path to the text files)
Generations: 3000														(one int)
Number_of_tags: 1														(one int)
Tau: 1.0																(one float)
Payoff_Matrix: 3 0 5 1													(floats)(Only four!) (Prisioner's'Dilemma example) ([0]=CC [1]=CD [2]=DC [3]=DD )
Percentages_of_tags_in_pop: 0 100										(int)
DataSubscribers: SimpleConsoleDataSubscriber TextFileDataSubscriber		(any number of the following: SimpleConsoleDataSubscriber TextFileDataSubscriber ConsoleDataSubscriber) AverageTextFileDataSubscriber
